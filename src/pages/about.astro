  <p>
    I'm Dylan, a fullstack developer with about <strong
      >5 years of experience</strong
    > building web applications. I specialize in <strong>React</strong> for the frontend
    and <strong>Node.js</strong> for the backend. I've worked on <strong
      >20+ diverse projects</strong
    > at BersStudio — from physical therapy training tools to smart meter rental
    systems and parcel tracking platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    My current focus is shifting toward <strong>DevOps</strong> and <strong
      >DevSecOps</strong
    >. I'm diving into tools like Docker (which I already use daily) and
    exploring CI/CD with GitHub Actions. I'm also learning <strong>Rust</strong>
    with the goal of mastering <strong>WebAssembly</strong> for high-performance
    web experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe in <strong>learning by building</strong>. I'm actively creating
    small labs and real-world environments to sharpen my skills and prepare for
    a DevOps-centric role in the near future.
