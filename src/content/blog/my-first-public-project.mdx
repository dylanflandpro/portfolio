## Who are you... readers ?

Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹, if you're reading this it's because you are looking after a developer with many skills just after me ðŸ˜Ž

Welcome to my first public project, this portfolio! ðŸŽ‰

## What can I found here?

This portfolio will be use to showcase my work and experiments. I plan to get track about various projects from my lab and use this space as a diary or report to document the challenges I encounter and how I solve them.

## Why now?

I have been working on many projects for a while now, but I never took the time to share them. And now I'm looking for work opportunities (permanent or freelance) and I think it's a good time to start sharing my work with the world.

## First steps

First, I need to choose a stack for my portfolio. I want something that is easy to maintain and update, and that allows me to focus on the content rather than the design. I also want it to be fast and responsive, so that it looks good on all devices. Eventually, if I can have some interactivity, it would be great!
I decided to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) as the framework for my portfolio. It's a modern static site generator that allows me to build fast and optimized websites with minimal effort. I also added [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, as it provides a utility-first approach that makes it easy to create responsive designs.

I made the about page with a simple introduction about myself, I uploaded my face and I added a link to my Malt and LinkedIn profiles. I will not add a contact form for now, as I prefer to keep it simple and direct people to my profiles where they can contact me. (Platforms are filtering spam and I don't want to deal with that for now)
So I made a first version and will see how it goes.

A few days later. I did the homepage after a little message to introduce the portfolio, I decide to show my experiences and skills. I created a component to display my experiences in a card format, with the company name, role, and a brief description. I also added images for each experience to make it visually appealing. I will open an issue to add page with experience details

For a first time using Astro I feel it intuitive and really easy to maintain, let's see in the future

## What's next?

Now that I have a basic portfolio up and running, I want to continue improving it and adding more content. Here are a few things on my to-do list:

- Add more projects: I want to showcase more of my work, including personal projects and experiments. I will create dedicated pages for each project, with detailed descriptions and links to the code repositories.

- Improve the design: While I am happy with the overall layout, I want to refine the design and make it more visually appealing. This includes updating the color scheme, typography, and spacing.

- Add interactivity: I would like to incorporate some interactive elements into the portfolio, such as animations or dynamic content. This will help make the experience more engaging for visitors.

- Optimize for SEO: I want to ensure that my portfolio is easily discoverable by search engines. This includes adding meta tags, optimizing images, and improving page load times.

- Gather feedback: I plan to share my portfolio with friends and colleagues to get their feedback. This will help me identify areas for improvement and make the portfolio even better.

Overall, I am excited to continue working on my portfolio and sharing my journey as a developer. Stay tuned for updates!
